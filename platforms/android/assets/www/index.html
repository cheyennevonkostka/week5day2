	    	<q>My first time in and my hair could not have come out more amazing! 
			Cierra was very friendly and listened to what I wanted. 
			She exceeded what I was expecting. 
			I haven't had a salon with a hairstylist that listened to what I wanted 
			and it came out to exactly what I wanted and more! 
			I loved the atmosphere and the girls there were very professional and fun. 
			I defiantly will be going back and will recommend people that what their hair done come here!</q>
